### A directory within the holbertonschool-unity repo ###
<br>
The initial purpose of this project was to build a simple 3D platformer game and to go further in depth with Assets to learn how to import and use them, along with models and textures.
<br><br>
The next repo added upon the original project by including new levels, music, a main and pause menu, and a win screen.
<br><br>
The repo after that added animations to the project. There was then an intro camera as well as animations for the player, which also got a proper model.
<br><br>
This repo adds Audio to the project, giving purpose to the sound sliders under the `Options` menu. Audio added includes background music, ambience, sound effects on every button, and upon model interactment such as walking, on respawn impact, and winning.
