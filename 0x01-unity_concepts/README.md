| 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/0-floor.unity | **Task: 0. Floor plans** <br> `0x01-unity_concepts` is the 3D Unity project. `0-floor` is the new scene, that has a new Cube GameObject named `Floor` with the following Transform properties: <ul><li>Position: `X: 0`, `Y: 0`, `Z: 0`</li><li>Rotation: `X: 0`, `Y: 0`, `Z: 0`</li><li>Scale: `X: 16`, `Y: 0.5`, `Z: 16`</li></ul> |
| 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/1-ball.unity | **Task: 1. On the ball** <br> A duplication of `0-floor` but renamed as `1-ball`. It has a new Sphere GameObject named `Ball` with the following Transform properties: <ul><li>Position: `X: 0`, `Y: 8`, `Z: 0`</li><li>Rotation: `X: 0`, `Y: 0`, `Z: 0`</li><li>Scale: `X: 1.5`, `Y: 1.5`, `Z: 1.5`</li></ul> |
| 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/2-colors.unity <br> 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/Materials/floor.mat <br> 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/Materials/ball.mat | **Task: 2. Colors!** <br> Duplication of `1-ball` but renamed as `2-colors`. It contains a `Materials` folder as well as a new material named `floor`. This material was given a random color and assigned to the Floor GameObject. Then another material named `ball` was created, it was also given a random color and assigned to the Ball GameObject. |
| 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/3-gravity.unity <br> 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/Physic Materials/bounce | **Task: 3. Gravity is a harsh mistress** <br> Duplication of `2-colors` but renamed as `3-gravity`. After a Rigidbody Component was added to the Ball GameObject, a new folder named `Physic Materials` was made. Then a new Physic Material called `bounce` was created to be added to the Ball's Sphere Collider. The final `bounce` material settings are: <ul><li>`Bounciness: 0.8`</li><li>`Bounce Combine: Maximum`</li></ul> |
| 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/4-prefab.unity <br> 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/Prefabs/Ball | **Task: 4. Prefabricated** <br> Duplication of `3-gravity` but renamed as `4-prefab`. A new folder named `Prefabs` was created in order to create a prefab from the Ball to add four more instances of the Ball to the scene. The customization of their positions and scales didn't matter. |
| 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/5-more_colors.unity <br> 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/Materials/ball-* | **Task: 5. Even more colors!** <br> Duplication of `4-prefab` but renamed as `5-more_colors`. The color of each ball was differentiated as they were changed and specified by these new materials: <ul><li>`ball-red` : `FF0000FF`</li><li>`ball-blue` : `0000FFFF`</li><li>`ball-green` : `00FF00FF`<li>`ball-white` : `FFFFFFFF`</li><li>`ball-black` : `000000FF`</li></ul> Then the GameObjects were renamed with their corresponding color name as follows: <ul><li>`Red Ball`</li><li>`Blue Ball`</li><li>`Green Ball`</li><li>`White Ball`</li><li>`Black Ball`</li></ul> |
| 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/6-tags.unity | **Task: 6. Tag yourself** <br> Duplication of `5-more_colors` but renamed as `6-tags`. Each Ball object was added a tag called `Obstacles`. |
| 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/100-textures.unity <br> 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/Materials/ball-texture <br> 0x01-unity_concepts/Assets/Textures/<texture_name> | **Task: 7. Textures** <br> Duplication of `6-tags` but renamed as `100-textures`. A new instance of Ball was created and named as `Textured Ball`, since a texture was added to it. The texture asset was located in a folder named `Textures`, with the name of the material being `ball-texture`. |
