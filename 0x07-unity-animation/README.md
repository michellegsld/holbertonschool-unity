## README for 0x07-unity-animation ##
### A directory within the holbertonschool-unity repo ###

The initial purpose of this project was to build a simple 3D platformer game and to go further in depth with Assets to learn how to import and use them, along with models and textures.

The next repo added upon the original project by including new levels, music, a main and pause menu, and a win screen.

This repo adds animations to the project. There will now be an intro camera as well as animations for the player, which will now have a proper model.
