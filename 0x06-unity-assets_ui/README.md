## README for 0x06-unity-assets_ui ##
### A directory within the holbertonschool-unity repo ###

The main purpose of this project was to build a simple 3D platformer game and to go further in depth with Assets to learn how to import and use them, along with models and textures.

This repo adds upon the original project by including new levels, music, a main and pause menu, and a win screen.
