## README for 0x05-unity-assets_models_textures ##
### A directory within the holbertonschool-unity repo ###

The main purpose of this project was to build a simple 3D platformer game and to go further in depth with Assets to learn how to import and use them, along with models and textures.

Models: Kenney's Nature Pack Extended
This is the website from which the models were acquired: https://kenney.nl/assets/nature-pack-extended
